# BerachainTestnet

This Project consists of a CLI app to farm different protocols and perform multiple interactions in the Berachain bArtio network.

The project structure will always be the same for each included application.

A directory is included with the name of the Application that has been added
1. ABI.js file 
2. index.js file
3. "Scripts" directory with files such as swaps, liquidity, apis etc...

The base structure that the project will have will be that from the base directory "BerachainTestnet" you will be able to interact with any of the integrated Applications only by executing "index.js"

For now the project is in the construction stage so if you want to use any of the already integrated applications, simply go to the "actions" directory and open the project folder in which you want to interact, you will be able to find the mentioned structure and just by having Your wallets configured in "wallets.json" which is in the base directory "BerachainTestnet" will be ready to start using the applications that are integrated here.


If there is any application in Berachain that you want to see in the project, do not hesitate to open a pull and I will investigate it so that I can add it in the near future.

Greetings!
